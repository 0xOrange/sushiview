## SushiView

Just like how SushiSwap is an evolution in Uniswaps protocol design, SushiView is trying to be an evolution is user-experience for DEX.

The current user-experience of Dex's are still no match for centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase. 

Uniswap currently is built like lego's, users are expected to use different services like swap/pool on app.uniswap.org, analytics on uniswap.info, maybe manage portfolio on zapper.fi etc. In a typical CeFi, all these are integrated.

SushiView is built for me, based on my experience using Uniswap. It may not be for you but I hope you find it useful.

SushiView will be [omakase](https://dhh.dk/2012/rails-is-omakase.html).
